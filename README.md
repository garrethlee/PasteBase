# PasteBase
A quick and nifty place to store your frequent copy pastes!

#### Background:

I created this extension as a response to my daily problem of forgetting <br> an account number (or ID or anything that is quite similar to that <br> nature), prompting me to re-open my Gmail for the thousandth time just to <br> get that email, copy that number/ID, and paste it... only to forget it again <br> the following day. The vicious cycle stops now!

#### About:

*PasteBase* is a React based application, utilizing the [Navigator API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator) to handle the <br>copy pasting. The rest is vanilla JS and HTML.

#### Where do I get it?

You can check out the Chrome Web Store entry [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pastebase/gmdeaigadfgaocinogdkaomlgeoeckbm).
